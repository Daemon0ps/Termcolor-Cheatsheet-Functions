# Termcolor Shorthand Functions
Termcolor Cheatsheet Functions. Shorthand functions for printing in color.
All printing is done with `(,end='')` so `chr(10)` mult be appended or prepended.

# tc_cheatsheet.py
This is the actual shorthand module itself.

# tc_lamnbda_contructor.py
This is what I used to parse the former `tc_lambda_old.py` module that I was using for shorthand Termcolor functions.

# tc_lambda_old.py
The old functions/lambdas
